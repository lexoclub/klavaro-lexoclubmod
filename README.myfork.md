# My Fork of ProjectName

This is a personal fork of the [Klavaro Touch Typing Tutor](https://klavaro.sourceforge.io/en/index.html) repository.
I created this fork to explore and learn C programming by studying and modifying a real-world codebase.

## Purpose

- Practice and improve my C programming skills
- Experiment with changes and custom features
- Learn from the structure, design, and real-world use of C
